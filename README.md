## How to Reload your GB Data:
### You might see that if you go to "Account" section in Preferences, the "Data Remaining" will still be the same, here's a way to fix it:
1. Go to preferences (like above)
2. Go to the **"Account"** section

5. Paste your **License Key** you copied and click **OK** (This may seem a bit stupid but you're essentially reloading the info. After that, you can see the **Data Remaining** being updated)

## Remember: The longer you open the application ( even if it's minimized ) it will still increase your Data. If you leave the application open overnight, it may give you up to 1 terabyte of Data.
